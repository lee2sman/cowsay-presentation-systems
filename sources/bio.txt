I am a new media artist, educator and organizer. I also make music, code, and am a professor at SUNY Purchase College. I like to create works with code, sound, and text, and collage. I make games, bots, interactive media, installations, websites, radio stations, and these are shown at galleries, museums, artist-run spaces and universities. And online too.
